Hypothesis that Arthur is murderer let's denote that as A. Likewise, Berthram being the murderer will be B and Charleton will be C.

We know one is the murderer and the other two are not! We can state this as:
A|B|C , ~(A&B) , ~(A&C) , ~(B&C)

Clausal Form yields:
A|B|C , ~A|~B , ~A|~C , ~B|~C

Sentence testimonies expressed by the suspects can be false if they are the murderer, so we shall write this possibility as X|sentence where X is a suspect.

Arthur says Bertham was victim's friend:
A|BFriend

Arthur says that Carleton hated the victim:
A|CHate

Bertham says that he was out of town:
B|~BTown

Someone out of town cannot have been the murderer so we can express this as:
~BTown -> ~B 
Clausal:
BTown|~B

Bertham says he "didn't even know the guy":
B|~BFriend

Carleton says that he saw Arthur and Bertham with the victim just before the murder (meaning they had to be in town):
C|ATown
C|BTown

If Carleton was lying than Arthur was out of town:
~ATown -> ~A
Clausal:
ATown|~A

Compiled together we have:
A|B|C		(1)
~A|~B		(2)
~A|~C		(3)
~B|~C		(4)
A|BFriend	(5)
A|CHate		(6)
B|~BTown	(7)
BP|~B		(8)
B|~BFriend	(9)
C|ATown		(10)
C|BTown		(11)
AP|~A		(12)

Forward Resolutions:
A|B		(13 = 5+9)
B|C		(14 = 7+11)
A|~C		(15 = 13+4)
~C		(16 = 15+3)
C|~A		(17 = 14+2)
~A		(18 = 17+3)
B		(19 = 13+18)

So we can conclude that Bertham is the murderer!
